# QTrojanAssessment

A generic trojan assessment platform developed with Qt5 framework. The project explored the usage of almost all widgets implemented in Qt framework.

## Get source code

Open your git bash and change to the directory into which you want to save the source code, and type the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:csuft/QTrojanAssessment.git .
```

When the command finished, you can find a newly created sub directory in the path you choosed.

## How to Compile

**System Prerequisite** 

 - ```Microsoft Visual Studio 2010``` or later
 - **CMake** is required.
 - Qt library version ```Qt 5.2.1-OpenGL```, earlier version may also work.
 - compatible with Qt 5.8 and VS 2015.

**Note**

> The project is developed using Qt5 framework, that means you have to install the latest Qt framework library on your machine. Though the framework is designed cross-platform, it won't be suitable for this project.  
> As we called large mounts of Windows API to implement most system dependent functions, it is necessary for you to make sure that the ```Windows SDK``` is present on your system path.
