1. Get source code
------------------
Open your git bash and change to the directory into which you want to save the source code, and type the following command:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:csuft/QTrojanAssessment.git .
```
When the command finished, you can find a newly created sub directory in the path you choosed.
2. Compile
----------
**System Prerequisite** 
 1. ```Microsoft Visual Studio 2010``` or later
 2. ```Windows XP SP3``` or higher
 3. Qt library version ```Qt 5.0.0-rc2```, earlier version may also work.
 4.  Qt plugin for MSVC2010 ```qt-vs-addin-1.2.0``` 


**Note**

>   The project is developed using Qt5.0 framework, that means you have to install the latest Qt framework library on your machine. Though the framework is designed cross-platform, it won't be suitable for this project.  
>   As we called large mounts of Windows API to implement most system dependent functions, it is necessary for you to make sure that the ```Windows SDK``` is present on your system path.
